Change the MAC address in Kali_linux.
The MAC address can be changed for some benefits, including:
1-Privacy: changing your MAC address can help protect your privacy by preventing advertisers and other organizations from tracking your online activities. Since MAC addresses are unique, they can be used to identify specific devices and individuals.
2-Security: Occasionally, modifying your MAC address can make you more secure. Changing your MAC address, for instance, can make it more difficult for hackers to target your device if you're using a public Wi-Fi network.
3-Network Troubleshooting: Sometimes, network issues can be resolved by changing your MAC address. For example, if your ISP has blocked your MAC address, changing it may allow you to reconnect to the internet.
4- MAC address conflicts: Connectivity problems could occur if many devices on a network have the same MAC address. One or more devices' MAC addresses may need to be changed to fix these problems.
5-Bypassing MAC address filtering: Some networks use MAC address filtering as a security measure to only allow specific devices to connect. Changing your MAC address can bypass this restriction and connect to the network.
